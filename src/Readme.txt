Fire Response Time Simulation
2018 SYST335

Instructions:
Compile all java files and run mainClass. 

- Visual Mode:
Visual mode is used to show outputs for one replication only. 
To run visual mode enter 'v' (without quotation marks), and enter desired greater alarm delay time (in minutes) .

- Fast Mode:
Fast Mode is used to simulate the model for 10000 replications. It also allows the user to run simulation for different greater alarm delay times (for instance from 10 minutes to 50 minutes). Inter-alarm delay times can also be set in the interval input field (Note: enter 0.5 for 30 seconds). 

Raw data is stored in the rawData folder (program creates new folder) results can be analyzed in Matlab using the analysisExcel.m file provided.

Statistical results are also saved in excel file named Statistics.csv
